          Working together with Prof. Casper Lassenius and another RA, we qualitatively analyzed the use of Agile software development in a large-scale organization. Gathering data from interviews and analyzing the data in a qualitative manner allowed us to get a better understanding behind how large-scale Agile software development is applied. Additionally, we researched how the organization deviated from the dogmatic teachings of Agile as well as the challenges and successes of doing so.

          Deciding to follow my interest in technology at scale, I decided to enroll in the Big Data and Large-scale Computing major. After finishing my first year, I have gotten experience in employing technologies such as CassandraDB, Apache Kafka, and Apache Nifi, to create platforms compatible with data sizes and velocities of terabytes a day. Additionally, I have gained experience in data mining and software architecture.

          Currently I am waiting to go on my exchange to Tokyo University in Tokyo, Japan, which will start in October 2024 and end in April 2025. I will be joining Prof. Yoshiro Kawahara's laboratory to conduct research and experience the Japanese culture.

          I partook in a research exchange at Prof. Yoshiro Kawahara's laboratory at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The research was conducted under the guidance of Prof. Hiroaki Murakami,
          which focused on thermal comfort at a university residence during summer. The research results were presented at the <a href="https://www.ipsj.or.jp/event/taikai/87/index.html" target="_blank">87th National Convention of ISPJ conference</a> in Osaka.

          The research title and abstract were the following:

          **Title**: A Case Study on Determinants of Thermal Comfort: Insights into Air Conditioning and Environmental Factors

          **Abstract**: To tackle social challenges and create new business opportunities related to the value of air, this study evaluates thermal comfort during the summer at a university residence, focusing on the effectiveness of air conditioning systems. 
          A survey with 27 participants was conducted, and the data were analyzed using various data mining techniques, such as correlation analysis, tabulations, and clustering. 
          The analysis indicates a correlation between thermal comfort and variables such as issues with humidity and odor, loss of focus, participant's origin, and window direction. 
          These findings offer insight into the determinants of thermal comfort, serving as a basis for further research into optimizing air conditioning systems and enhancing the value of air in creating more sustainable and comfortable living environments.

Similarly to the research I conducted with Prof. Casper Lassenius in 2020, the Thesis was a qualitative analysis on the unique challenges and benefits when adopting Agile at large scale for teams with members distributes to different sites. I was awarded a 5 out of 5 for my well-researched and in-depth analysis of the current state of Agile at scale.

          At my first hackathon Junction 2023, our team manages to solve the intricate issue of utilizing generative Artificial Intelligence in a sustainable manner to collect and summarize real time insight to help drive business decisions. 

          Using efficient retrieval augmentation, our solution focused on validating the output of various LLMs in a sustainable manner, to allow the user to inspect the origin of each sentence, and evaluate how reliable each sentence of the output was - with only ONE call to the LLM. This increases the transparency and reliability in the received output.

          Out of all the 37 submission for our category, we managed to snatch the second place!
